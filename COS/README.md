**Clone this [repo](https://github.com/Lars-m/restClassDemoDay1.git)** to get what we did in the class

These links cover more or less what I have/will talk about today:

Read [RESTfull Web Services](http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/restful-web-services-a-tutorial/240169069?pgno=1) or Watch [What is REST](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html)

Use this [link](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gilik.html) as a quick summary of the most important annotations we will use to create our REST-endpoints

This is the [main resource for jersey](https://jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/index.html) (the implementaion of the JAX-RS interface we are using)
