# REST (RESTful Webservices) with JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services)

Individual plans, exercises and reading guides for COS and DAT classes can be found here:

[DAT](https://github.com/Cphdat3sem2017f/REST/tree/master/DAT) - [COS](https://github.com/Cphdat3sem2017f/REST/tree/master/COS)

## Learning objectives
- Learn the ideas behind implementing and API via REST and JSON.
- Learn how to implement a REST API using Java's JAX-RX API
- Learn how to deal with both success and failure scenarious in a REST API
- Learn how to test a REST API using REST Assured.

## Business competences
REST has become the current standard for designing web API's

This week will provide students with the background to join teams, implementing REST API's in any language/platform, even if this week uses JAX-RS.

This article gives a nice language independent introduction to REST (remember REST is not a Java thing, but can be implemented with Java) [RESTful Web Services: A Tutorial](http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/restful-web-services-a-tutorial/240169069?pgno=1)

This is the user guide for the Java Jersey API we are using to implement REST. Don't be scared by the "size" of this Guide. Use it, just as a reference, when you need info about specific details.
